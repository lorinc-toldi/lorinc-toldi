# Hey, I'm Nate!

### I'm a co-creator and core maintainer of [Astro  🚀](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro). You should [try it now](https://astro.new), in your browser!

Recently, I was the architect of Astro's [WASM-powered compiler](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro-compiler-next) written in Go ✨. This whole journey began with a SSG I created called [Microsite](https://github.com/natemoo-re/microsite) 🤏. Before that, I was really into writing utility web components like [`animate-presence`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/animate-presence) and [`konami-listener`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/konami-listener).

As a former Graphic Designer, I'll always have a soft spot for design. The space between development and design is where I thrive.
